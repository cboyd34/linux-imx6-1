* Freescale Secure Non-Volatile Storage (SNVS) RTC

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,sec-v4.0-mon"
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/crypto/fsl-sec4.txt for details.
- reg: Physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: Two interrupt numbers to the cpu should be specified. First
  interrupt number is the consolidated interrupt in non TrustZone. The second
  interrupt number is the security interrupt in TrustZone. The number of cells
  representing a interrupt depends on the parent interrupt controller.

Example:

snvs@020cc000 {
       compatible = "fsl,sec-v4.0-mon";
       reg = <0x020cc000 0x4000>;
       interrupts = <0 19 0x04 0 20 0x04>;
};
