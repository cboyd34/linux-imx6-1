==================

Required properties:
 - xres, yres: Display resolution
 - left_margin, right_margin, hsync_len: Horizontal Display timing parameters
   in pixels
   upper_margin, lower_margin, vsync_len: Vertical display timing parameters in
   lines
 - clock: displayclock in Hz

Optional properties:
 - width_mm, height_mm: Display dimensions in mm
 - hsync_active_high (bool): Hsync pulse is active high
 - vsync_active_high (bool): Vsync pulse is active high
 - interlaced (bool): This is an interlaced mode
 - doublescan (bool): This is a doublescan mode

There are different ways of describing a display mode. The devicetree representation
corresponds to the one used by the Linux Framebuffer framework described here in
Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt. This representation has been chosen because it's
the only format which does not allow for inconsistent parameters.Unlike the Framebuffer
framework the devicetree has the clock in Hz instead of ps.

Example:

	display@0 {
		/* 1920x1080p24 */
		clock = <52000000>;
		xres = <1920>;
		yres = <1080>;
		left_margin = <25>;
		right_margin = <25>;
		hsync_len = <25>;
		lower_margin = <2>;
		upper_margin = <2>;
		vsync_len = <2>;
		hsync_active_high;
	};
